# Welcome to Wardle!

Wardle is a text based game, similar to Wordle of the New York Times.  The aim of the game is to correctly guess a five digit word within six attempts. Generally, there are four scenarios that can take place: -

1. You correctly guess the word, in which case a success message is output similar to the following: -

    `Congrats! That's an exact match`

2. You enter a word that contains some letters in the same place as the hidden word. In this circumstance, the word will be displayed on the console with green boxes indicating which letters are in the correct position.

3. You enter a word that contains some letters that are in the hidden word. These letters will be highlighted in yellow.

4. You enter a word that contains different letters from the hidden word. These letters will be highlighted in red.

After six attempts, you'll see a message similar to the following, which indicates that the game is over: -

`Bad luck - you're out of attempts. Better luck next time!`

*Best of luck!*

Wardle is a single player game.  A player has to guess a five letter hidden word.  You
have six attempts, and you can track your progress as follows: -

✔ -> Indicates that the letter at that position was guessed correctly.
➕ -> Indicates that the letter exists in the hidden word, but at a different position.
❌ -> Indicates that the letter does not exist in the word.
